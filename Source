#As this is a problem of multiclass classification, so I will be using the Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm to train the language detection model as this algorithm always performs very well on the problems based on multiclass classification:
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train,y_train)
model.score(X_test,y_test)
#Now let’s use this model to detect the language of a text by taking a user input:
user = input("Enter a Text: ")
data = cv.transform([user]).toarray()
output = model.predict(data)
print(output)
#So as you can see that the model performs well.
