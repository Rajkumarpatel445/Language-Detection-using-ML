## üìñ About

Language detection plays a vital role in various multilingual applications such as translation systems, chatbots, content filtering, and social media analytics.  
This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques along with **Machine Learning** to classify the input text into one of the many supported languages.

## ‚ú® Features

- Supports detection of multiple languages.
- Uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
- Simple and fast model for real-time predictions.
- Clean and easy-to-read Python code.
- Can be extended to support more languages and algorithms.
